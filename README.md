# GTEx-Expression-Analysis-RStudio

The analysis begins with data cleaning and wrangling, where the dataset is imported and tidied using the tidyverse, followed by merging gene expression and metadata tables, and filtering, reshaping, and transforming the data as needed (e.g., log-transform). Next, exploratory data analysis is conducted to visualize gene expression patterns across tissues or other sample attributes, utilizing PCA, correlation heatmaps, or boxplots to explore the structure of the data. The modeling phase includes regression, classification, and clustering techniques, with additional methods incorporated if necessary, and model performance assessed using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, AUC, accuracy). Clustering and unsupervised learning involve performing clustering (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering) on samples or genes and comparing clustering results to known metadata (e.g., tissue types, sex, or other labels). Finally, interpretation and communication are crucial, using plots and tables to clearly present findings, interpreting regression coefficients and cluster memberships in a biological context, and discussing insights, limitations, and possible directions for further analysis.
